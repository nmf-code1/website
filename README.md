# No Man's Fort Website

This project contains a simple HTML/CSS framework for the No Man's Fort website. The content here provides a starting point that can be refined and expanded.

## Getting Started

Open `index.html` in your browser to view the site. No build steps are needed.

## Project Structure

- `index.html` – Home page
- `about.html` – History and fort details
- `experience.html` – Luxury stay and amenities
- `events.html` – Events and creative hire
- `invest.html` – Lease or purchase information
- `contact.html` – Basic enquiry form
- `styles/` – Contains `main.css` for styling
- `script.js` – Simple JavaScript loaded on the pages
- `images/` – Local image files referenced in the site. The directory contains
  a `.gitkeep` placeholder so it remains in version control even when empty.
  Add your own images there and update the HTML as needed to use them.
Feel free to adapt these files as the project evolves.
