# Starter Website

This repository contains a simple starter website built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It provides a basic structure that can be extended as we continue to develop the project.

## Getting Started

Open `index.html` in your browser to view the website. No additional build steps are required.

## Project Structure

- `index.html` - Main page of the website
- `styles/main.css` - Basic styling
- `script.js` - Simple JavaScript loaded on the page

Feel free to modify these files to adapt the website to your needs.
